//Runtime=Runtime is how much time a function take time to run

//Types of Time Complexity

//1. Constant= The Runtime remains same that how much the input is big

//2. Linear=  As the input grow the Rumtime linearly grow

//3. Quadratic= The quadratic of the input when the input is 1 the runtime became 10

//4.Logarithmic
